    <h2>PARADISE</h2>
    <h4>Coldplay</h4>
    Lyrics - Letras <br><br>
    <p>When she was just a girl, she expected the world <br>
    But it flew away from her reach <br>
    So she ran away in her sleep and dreamed of <br>
    Para-para-paradise, para-para-paradise, para-para-paradise <br>
    Every time she closed her eyes </p>
    <p>When she was just a girl, she expected the world <br>
    But it flew away from her reach and the bullets catch in her teeth <br>
    Life goes on, it gets so heavy <br>
    The wheel breaks the butterfly, every tear a waterfall<br>
    In the night, the stormy night, she'd close her eyes<br>
    In the night, the stormy night, away she'd fly </p>
    <p>And dream of para-para-paradise<br>
    Para-para-paradise<br>
    Para-para-paradise </p>
    <p>She'd dream of para-para-paradise<br>
    Para-para-paradise<br>
    Para-para-paradise </p>
    <p>La-la-la-la-la-la-la<br>
    La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la <br>
    And so lying underneath those stormy skies<br>
    She'd say, "oh<br>
    I know the sun must set to rise" </p>
    <p>This could be para-para-paradise<br>
    Para-para-paradise </p>
    <p>This could be para-para-paradise<br>
    (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh) </p>
    <p>This could be para-para-paradise<br>
    Para-para-paradise </p>
    <p>This could be para-para-paradise<br>
    (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh) </p>
    <p>This could be para-para-paradise<br>
    Para-para-paradise </p>
    <p>This could be para-para-paradise<br>
    (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh) </p>

    <h2>THE SCIENTIST</h2>
    <h4>Coldplay</h4>
    Lyrics - Letras <br><br>
    <p>Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry<br>
    You don't know how lovely you are<br>
    I had to find you, tell you I need you<br>
    Tell you I set you apart</p>
    <p>Tell me your secrets and ask me your questions<br>
    Oh, let's go back to the start<br>
    Running in circles, coming up tails<br>
    Heads on a science apart</p>
    <p>Nobody said it was easy<br>
    It's such a shame for us to part<br>
    Nobody said it was easy<br>
    No one ever said it would be this hard<br>
    Oh, take me back to the start</p>
    <p>I was just guessing at numbers and figures<br>
    Pulling the puzzles apart<br>
    Questions of science, science and progress<br>
    Do not speak as loud as my heart<br>
    But tell me you love me, come back and haunt me<br>
    Oh and I rush to the start</p>
    <p>Running in circles, chasing our tails<br>
    Coming back as we are</p>
    <p>Nobody said it was easy<br>
    Oh, it's such a shame for us to part<br>
    Nobody said it was easy<br>
    No one ever said it would be so hard<br>
    I'm going back to the start</p>

    <h2>YELLOW</h2>
    <h4>Coldplay</h4>
    Lyrics - Letras <br><br>
    <p>Look at the stars<br>
    <p>Look how they shine for you</p>
    And everything you do</p>
    <p>Yeah, they were all yellow</p>
    I came along<br>
    I wrote a song for you<br>
    <p>And all the things you do</p>
    <p>And it was called Yellow</p>
    So then I took my turn<br>
    Oh, what a thing to have done<br>
    <p>And it was all yellow</p>
    Your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones<br>
    Turn into something beautiful<br>
    And you know, you know I love you so</p>
    <p>You know I love you so</p>
    I swam across<br>
    I jumped across for you<br>
    Oh, what a thing to do<br>
    'Cause you were all yellow</p>
    <p>I drew a line<br>
    I drew a line for you<br>
    Oh, what a thing to do<br>
    And it was all yellow</p>
    <p>And your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones<br>
    Turn into something beautiful<br>
    And you know, for you, I'd bleed myself dry<br>
    For you, I'd bleed myself dry</p>
    <p>It's true<br>
    Look how they shine for you<br>
    Look how they shine for you<br>
    Look how they shine for<br> 
    Look how they shine for you<br>
    Look how they shine for you<br>
    Look how they shine</p>
    <p>Look at the stars<br>
    Look how they shine for you<br>
    And all the things that you do</p>
